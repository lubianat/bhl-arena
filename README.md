# Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) Arena 

The BHL Arena is a game that helps prioritizing the most beautiful BHL files on Wikimedia Commons. 

Users may vote on their favourites, helping ranking beautiful images high and, consequently, prioritizing them for metadata curation and reuse on Wikimedia Projects. 

The tool is based on Wikimedia Commons and the [BHL-Wiki partnership](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/BHL).

## Technical on the selection bias

The algorithm for "randomly" pulling the files is biased towards pages that have been most visited. That works nicely for Wikipedia, but maybe not so much for discovering files in a Commons Category :) 

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Random_page for details.
